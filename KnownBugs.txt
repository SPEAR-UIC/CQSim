This is a list of the current bugs that are known in the GUI

BUG LIST:

- when hitting the Run Button, it will set up the graph but when the simulation runs, the graph is not updated. 
  You can just press the back button and hit run again until it works.

- Error with tkinter vars when you empty them. When you delete the parameters that ask for ints or doubles, the GUI will throw out an error
  about not accepting empty strings in the vars. Restarting the GUI will reset this bug.
